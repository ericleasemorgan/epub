            <p>The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them&#8212;all sorts of little birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard him; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand and a scroll of parchment in the other. In the very middle of the court was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it. "I wish they'd get the trial done," Alice thought, "and hand 'round the refreshments!"</p>

            <p>The judge, by the way, was the King and he wore his crown over his great wig. "That's the jury&#8211;box," thought Alice; "and those twelve creatures (some were animals and some were birds) I suppose they are the jurors."</p>
            <p>Just then the White Rabbit cried out "Silence in the court!"</p>
            <p>"Herald, read the accusation!" said the King.</p>
            <p>On this, the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, then unrolled the parchment&#8211;scroll and read as follows:</p>
            <blockquote>
               <div class="line-group">The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;All on a summer day;<br/>The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;And took them quite away!</div>
            </blockquote>
            <p>"Call the first witness," said the King; and the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet and called out, "First witness!"</p>
            <p>The first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one hand and a piece of bread and butter in the other.</p>
            <p>"You ought to have finished," said the King. "When did you begin?"</p>
            <p>The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the court, arm in arm with the Dormouse. "Fourteenth of March, I <em>think</em> it was," he said.</p>
            <p>"Give your evidence," said the King, "and don't be nervous, or I'll have you executed on the spot."</p>
            <p>This did not seem to encourage the witness at all; he kept shifting from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and, in his confusion, he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the bread and butter.</p>
            <p>Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation&#8212;she was beginning to grow larger again.</p>
            <p>The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread and butter and went down on one knee. "I'm a poor man, Your Majesty," he began.</p>
            <p>"You're a <em>very</em> poor <em>speaker</em>," said the King.</p>
            <p>"You may go," said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court.</p>
            <p>"Call the next witness!" said the King.</p>
            <p>The next witness was the Duchess's cook. She carried the pepper&#8211;box in her hand and the people near the door began sneezing all at once.</p>
            <p>"Give your evidence," said the King.</p>
            <p>"Sha'n't," said the cook.</p>
            <p>The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said, in a low voice, "Your Majesty must cross&#8211;examine <em>this</em> witness."</p>
            <p>"Well, if I must, I must," the King said. "What are tarts made of?"</p>
            <p>"Pepper, mostly," said the cook.</p>
            <p>For some minutes the whole court was in confusion and by the time they had settled down again, the cook had disappeared.</p>
            <p>"Never mind!" said the King, "call the next witness."</p>
            <p>Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list. Imagine her surprise when he read out, at the top of his shrill little voice, the name "Alice!"</p>
